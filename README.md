# Earthquake-Data-Visualization
<img aling = "center" src="/map.png" width="700" />

In this project, I used Java to perform data visualization on earth quake data. The data is read live and the plots are made basing on the magnitude of the earth quake. This was my project for my OOP using Java programming class on Coursera.
